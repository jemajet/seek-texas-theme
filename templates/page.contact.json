He’s always felt that more people needed to get out and see the amazing stories and people who called Texas home. Then, two events coincided. He and his mother, aged 93 years, won a jackpot of money on “Wheel of Fortune.” (Check out “93-year-old Liz Wheel of Fortune.”) Together, they decided to put it towards Texas history. But how? A trip through Quanah, Texas and a number of the arrows placed along the Quanah Parker Trail provided the spark of inspiration. Arrows. A trail. A map. A puzzle. A hunt. A treasure hunt, to inspire people to find the real Texas! To literally seek Texas!</p><p></p><p></p>"
